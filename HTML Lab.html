        <p>I am a member of Yiga clan, working for the Glorious Master Kohga. Our Purpose is to destory the Legendary Hero and take over Hyrle. I am but a humble footsoldier who was given the oppurtunitiy help fulfil our glorius purpose. I plan on using this website to describe what my life is like!</p>
        <strong class = 'big'>My Duties as a Footsoldier</strong>
        <p></p>
        <strong class = "things">Find and Destory Link</strong>
        <p>First and foremost, there is one person who keeps getting in our way from taking over Hyrule. His name is Link, and he is know as the Legendary Hero. He is really good with a sword, even better that we are. He even beat Master Kohga once! (which seems impossible, but now our Glorious Leader is stuck in the Depths.) So we have to restort to tricking him into giving us an advantage. Here are some things I have tried. </p>
        <p class = 'tatical'>*** I disguised myself as a grilled banana merchant and sold him one of our Mighty Bananas (A worthy sacrifice)</p>
        <p class = 'result'>Result: He is too strong for just me</p>
        <p class = 'tatical'>*** My boss disguised himself as Zelda, and seveal of us pretended to take him hostage. All of us attacked at once when he got close!</p>
        <p class = 'result'>Result: He managed to escape</p>
        <p class = 'tatical'>*** We put mighty bananas in a cave to lure Link in. (Who could resist a mighty banana? Unfortunatly none of us were willing to spare one, so I had to disguise myself as one.)</p>
        <p class = 'result'>Result: We had to retreat, He's just too strong for us. Maybe Master Kohga could defeat him with all the tech we have found in the abyss.</p>        
        <strong class = 'things'>Exploring the depths</strong>        
        <p>As part of my duties, I have been tasked with exporing the depths of Hyrule, in order to find better firepower to defeat the Hero and to help the Demon Lord destoy the world. Unfortunatly, I haven't found much. There was a large sphere like object, but it exploded after flashing blue a few times while I was carrying it. I found a rocket as well, but it flew off to fast for me to follow. The monsters down here don't like us either, so we have to be very careful and explore in the dark. Our boss put me in charge of defending our base since I haven't had much luck with exporing. So now I get to fly the plane around the base! They said it was punishment, but this has been a lot of fun!</p>
        <strong class = 'things' >Move supplies to and from the Depths</strong>
        <p>This is the worst part of my job. It's so boring to wait on the ballons as they go up and down. And we can only put so many supplies on one ballon. If we put on too much, it just falls. And we can't use more ballons becuase they run into each other going opposites directions. There is so much stuff that is just sitting in the Yiga Hideout, collecting dust. But I get all the Mighty Bananas that are going bad!</p>
